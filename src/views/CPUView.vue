    <h1>CPU Load Metric</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    The load of CPU cores can be taken by their internal metrics of time called
	jiffies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case of HPC simulations, the CPU load is gained by Application Companion,
	a software tool close to the simulation code itself which is running in the HPC
	environment.
