  <p>Given the diagnostic sources of (1) and (2), whose application may be regarded as more or less routine, now – as the one single question to consider is whether to shut off a run or keep it going – everything needs to be composed to one such single recommendation, and that in a manner appropriate to the individual settings of a such simulation run. For this sake historical data about the referred simulation (and maybe similar ones) is kept, to provide inside how to calibrate best.</p>

<p>Technically the calibrations will be weights, but some kinds of rules may also be useful. In the end, rather than a red-green ‘traffic lights’, the final yield rather should be continuous, like [0,1], or 0-100%, to give the user input for qualified final consideration. Moreover, certain probabilistic systems like Bayesian ones do additionally provide a level of uncertainty, very much like histograms.</p>

<p>As the decision about shutting down a simulation is of considerable responsibility, it may be helpful for a user to see a given CSMI recommendation actually is undecided – opening up a meaningful opportunity to, to a limited extent, further extend the consideration before deciding. Also it might help to filter out diagnostic sources turning out to be overly indecisive.</p>
